## About

This isn't just another web project,it's a digital love letter, a collection of memories, and a celebration of all the moments that make us _us_. Built with modern web technologies and sprinkled with animations, this interactive experience is designed to bring a smile to someone special.

## Features

- **Photo Carousel** - A beautiful showcase of our favorite memories together
- **Smooth Animations** - Powered by GSAP for that extra _flair_
- **Responsive Design** - Looks great on any device, because love shouldn't be constrained by screen size
- **Special Touches** - Includes surprises that only we would understand (yes, Pitbull is involved)
- **Tailwind Styling** - Clean, modern, and as beautiful as the person it's made for

## Built With

- **[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)** - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - For type-safe love notes
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** - Lightning-fast development experience
- **[Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)** - Navigate through our memories
- **[GSAP](https://greensocket.com/)** - Gorgeous animations that match the butterflies in my stomach
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Beautiful styling without the fuss

## Development

This project uses:
- Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs for cleaner, more expressive components
- TypeScript for type safety (because our love is strongly typed)
- Vite for blazing-fast hot module replacement
- Tailwind CSS v4 for modern, utility-first styling

## Highlights

Every scroll, every click, every animation has been thoughtfully crafted. From the carousel of memories to the little details that only we would notice—this project is a testament to creativity, care, and a whole lot of caffeine.

## Future Ideas

Check out [IDEAS.md](./IDEAS.md) for upcoming features and improvements! This project is a living thing, just like our story—always growing, always evolving.

## Made With Love

Created with an unhealthy amount of attention to detail and an even unhealthier amount of coffee. Every line of code, every pixel, every animation—made for you.
